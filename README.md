## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to keep my code DRY. Also, it was my first time completing a project without using a Figma mockup. I learned how to use use Figma to convert screenshots into a Figma design. That way I can get a clear estimate on the padding, width, and margin.

### Continued development

I aim to continue exploring various styling and responsive design techniques. I am particularly excited about learning new methods that enhance user experience and make web interfaces more intuitive and engaging.
